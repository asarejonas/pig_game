# Pig Game

This is a simple Pig Game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players and follows the standard rules of Pig, a popular dice game.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** Be the first player to reach 100 points.
2. **Equipment:** You need two standard dice and a way to keep score.
3. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns rolling the dice.
      - On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The numbers rolled are added to their current turn total.
         - If a player rolls a 1 on either die, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
	    - If a player chooses to "hold" (end their turn), their turn total is added to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
	       - The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
	       4. **Special Rules:**
	          - Doubles: Rolling doubles earns a bonus roll.
		     - Pig Out: Rolling a 1 on either die resets the current turn's score to zero.
		     5. **Strategy:** Players must decide when to take risks and when to play it safe to reach 100 points.
